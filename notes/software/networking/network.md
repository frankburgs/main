# Notes
- Pinging an IP address with no port specified defaults to port 80 ‚ùî

Obtain an IP address automatically: When a device is configured to obtain an IP address automatically, it will use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server on the network.  

The DHCP server will assign an IP address to the device, along with other network settings, such as the subnet mask and default gateway. This can simplify network management and reduce the likelihood of address conflicts.  

Obtain a DNS server address automatically: When a device is configured to obtain a DNS server address automatically, it will use the DHCP protocol to obtain the address of a DNS server on the network.  
The DNS server address will be provided by the same DHCP server that assigns the IP address to the device. This can simplify network management by automatically providing the DNS server address to devices on the network  

Primary DNS server address: The IP address of the first DNS server that a device will use to resolve domain names to IP addresses. When a device receives a request to resolve a domain name, it will first send the request to the primary DNS server.  

Secondary DNS server address: The the IP address of a backup DNS server that a device can use if the primary DNS server is unavailable. If the primary DNS server is unable to resolve a domain name, the device will then send the request to the secondary DNS server.

# Networking
- There are thousands of network protocols, but they all do the same 3 things:
- Security, encryption, authentication, transportation,
- Communication: same
- Network management: connection, link aggregation, troubleshooting.
- Lower Ghz better over longer distance for wifi.
- There exists traditional and cloud IT infrastructures (not in one spot).
- Secure access service edge (SASE).
- Older internet is dial up, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL).
- Newer internet is cable, fiber optic, satellite, and cellular üóº.
- Wireless internet service providers (WISP, cellphone companies).
- Topology defines a network's structure.
- Logical topology describes data flow across physical connections.
- A device that accesses the server is known as a client.
- A node that accesses the server to get on the network is known as a client.
- All devices that can send, receive, & create info on a network are nodes.
## Mobile
- Product release instruction (PRI) device network configuration settings.
- Preferred roaming list (PRL) sets which cell towers to use whilst roaming.
- Radio firmware is softwre that manages wireless connections.
- E-mail on mobile is POP3 (removes downloaded emails from server) or IMAP4 (saves emails on server).
- Use SSL or S/MIME to encrypt emails for security & authentication.
- International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI, unique # for phones on GSM, UMTS, LTE, and iDEN networks) and international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI, stored on device's sim card) are used to identify cell devices and users.
## Encryption
- Requires password, multiple encryption types available (WPA2 is strongest and most common).
- Captive portal is a web page pop-up used to authenticate new users to a wifi. Not a secure connection.
- Service set identifier (SSID) is name of a wireless network.
- 2.4 GHz band modes are 802.11 b,g,n.

### Layer OSI
- Application, users interacting with an app.
- Presentation, where encryption occurs, ensure data is in a usable format.
- session, authentication and reconnections, ensure communication between devices.
- transport, manages delivery and error checking of packets. (TCP)
- network, interpreting addresses, determining path.
- data link, defines data format on the network, corrects errors.
- physical, electrically transfers data over a physical medium.
### Layer TCP IP
- Application, transport, network, data link, physical.

## Subnet
- Subnetting is the process of taking a large, single network and splitting it up into many individual smaller subnetworks (subnets).
- A subnet masks identify the boundary between the IP network and the IP host.
- A subnet is like an IP address but for only internal network usage.
- Routers use subnet masks to route data to the right place.
## Automatic private IP addressing (APIPA)
- OS feature like Windows that lets computers self-configure an IP address and subnet mas automatically when the DHCP server isn't available (use ipconfig in the prompt if this causes no connectivity)
## Network address translation (NAT)
- Maps multiple local private addresses to a public one before transferring information.
- Organizations that want their traffic to originate from a single IP address use NAT as do most home routers.
## Dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP)
- Easiest broadband type to use but others available.
- Most common boradband type, used in cable modem connections.
- Automates configuration of IP network devices.
- Uses a pool of reserved IP addresses to automatically assign dynamic IP addresses or allocate a permanent IP address to a device.
- In static allocation the server uses a manually assigned "permanent" IP address for a device.
- Static IP is more common in business.
- Dynamic allocation the server chooses which IP address to assign a device each time it connects to the network.
- Automatic allocation is the server assigning a "permanent" IP address for a device automatically.
## IP packets transmission modes
- Packets are also called frames, blocks, cells, or segments.
### Unicast
- Transmissioh to a single destination, this is most internet traffic (HTTP, FTP).
### Anycast
- Transmission to any of the closest multiple nodes that has the correct unicast address.
### Multicast
- Transmission to all nodes that have subscribed to the multicast group or address.
- Limited to UDP protocol.
### Broadcast
- Transmission to all other nodes on the subnet.
- i.e. to find a DHCPv4 server broadcast transmission is limited to UDP protocol over IPv4 only.

## Data transmission flow
### Simplex
- Unidirectional communication between two devices, one can only send and the other only receive.
### Half-duplex
- Both stations can transmit and receive asynchronously.
### Full-duplex
- Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.
## Routers
- Connect to modems.
- Interconnect different networks or subnetworks.
- Manage traffic between networks by forwarding data packets.
- Allow multiple devices to use the same internet connection.
- Reads a packet's header to determine path.
- Uses internal routing table which is a list of paths to various network destinations.
- Forwards the packet to the next network in the path.
## Modem
- Modulator-demodulator, converts data into an easily network-transmittable format.
- When data arrives @ destination the receiving modem converts it back to original form.
- Cable and DSL are most common modems in use today.
- (Point to point protocol over ethernet) PPPoE used in DSL connections in areas that don't have newer options.
## Bridge
- Joins two separate networks so they can work as a single network.
- Wireless bridges can support wifi to wifi, wifi to ethernet, and bluetooth to wifi.
## Gateway

## Wireless access point (WAP)
- Allows wifi devices to connect to a wired network.
- Usually connects to a wired router as a standalone device.
- Acts as central wireless connection point for computers equipped with wireless network adapters.
- Plugged into a wired network switch.
- Reads each computers MAC address and forwards to wired switch.
- If wired network is connected to router with internet access, the wireless network will also have internet access.
## Network interface card (NIC)
- Connect device to a network.
- Can be wired or wireless, most computers have built-in wireless NICs.
- Most include ports for network cables.
## Client-server
- File transfer protocol (FTP) sites.
- Web servers & web browsers.
## Peer-to-peer
- File sharing sites, discussion forums, media streaming, and VoIP.
## Hub
- When hub receives data it broadcasts it to all connected devices.
- A switch is similar to a hub except it keeps a table of MAC addresses, and when it receives data it sends to specific address(es ?), which makes them more efficient than hubs.
- Switches and hubs connect to modems.
- If a switch or a hub fails it brings the entire network down.
## Physical topology
### Star
