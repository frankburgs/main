## Printers
- Non-impact : laser, inkjet, thermal.
- Inkjet : places small dots, can smudge.
- Laser : toner in a drum adheres to where laser touches it and is passed on to paper.
- Thermal : another non-impact printer, uses thermal paper with wax based ink, turns black with heat (used for barcodes due to high tolerances)
- Dot matrix : old tech, impact printer, can print multi-copy (carbon-copy) documents, very durable.

### Troubleshooting
- Paper jam could be caused by debris or faulty pickup rollers (older printers, get worn out, inspect)
- Check printer display for error msg
- Streaks could be ink cartridges
- Use printer sotware to try to troubleshoot streaks (clean printheads)
- May need to manually clean with a lint-free cloth.
- Faded or blank images, may be low ink or something else.
- Ghosting : faint image of previously printed page (drum or fuser, has a lifespan)
