# Networking
- There exists traditional and cloud IT infrastructures (not in one spot).
- Secure access service edge (SASE).
- Older internet is dial up, integrated services digital network (ISDN), digital subscriber line (DSL).
- Newer internet is cable, fiber optic, satellite, and cellular 🗼.
- Wireless internet service providers (WISP, cellphone companies).
- Topology defines a network's structure.
- Logical topology describes data flow across physical connections.
- A device that accesses the server is known as a client.
- A node that accesses the server to get on the network is known as a client.
- All devices that can send, receive, & create info on a network are nodes.
- Packets are also called frames, blocks, cells, or segments.
## Data transmission flow
### Simplex
- Unidirectional communication between two devices, one can only send and the other only receive.
#### Half duplex
- Both can transmit and receive asynchronously.
## Routers
- Connect to modems.
- Interconnect different networks or subnetworks.
- Manage traffic between networks by forwarding data packets.
- Allow multiple devices to use the same internet connection.
- Reads a packet's header to determine path.
- Uses internal routing table which is a list of paths to various network destinations.
- Forwards the packet to the next network in the path.
## Modem
- Modulator-demodulator, converts data into an easily network-transmittable format.
- When data arrives @ destination the receiving modem converts it back to original form.
- Cable and DSL are most common modems in use today.
## Bridge
- Joins two separate networks so they can work as a single network.
- Wireless bridges can support wifi to wifi, wifi to ethernet, and bluetooth to wifi.
## Gateway
